    title: "Why Pediatrics Interviews Need Specialty-Specific Preparation",
    points: [
      "Peds programs evaluate your genuine love for working with children AND families. You need compelling stories that demonstrate patience, playfulness, creativity, and your ability to connect with kids of all ages.",
      "Communication with families is critical. Programs assess your ability to explain complex medical information to worried parents, navigate difficult conversations, and demonstrate cultural sensitivity with diverse families.",
      "Subspecialty interests matter (cards, hem-onc, neonatology, etc.), but programs want to know you're committed to comprehensive pediatrics training first. We help you frame your interests appropriately.",
      "Advocacy and community pediatrics are increasingly important. Programs look for candidates who understand health equity, vaccination advocacy, child poverty, and social determinants of pediatric health."

    "Describe a time you had to communicate complex medical information to a worried family.",

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Do I need to have my own children to match in pediatrics?",
      answer: "Absolutely not! While some applicants are parents, many successful pediatrics residents have no children of their own. What matters is your genuine connection with children, your patience, creativity, and ability to relate to kids. Focus on your clinical experiences, volunteer work with children, or other interactions that demonstrate your comfort and effectiveness with pediatric patients."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I show passion for pediatrics in my interview?",
      answer: "Use specific stories and examples. Don't just say 'I love kids' - describe a memorable patient encounter that moved you, explain what you love about pediatric development, or discuss a moment when you realized pediatrics was your calling. Show enthusiasm for the unique aspects of pediatrics: watching kids grow, partnering with families, preventive care, and advocacy."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I mention my subspecialty interest in my pediatrics interview?",
      answer: "Yes, but frame it carefully. It's great to have subspecialty interests (cards, hem-onc, neonatology, etc.), but emphasize your commitment to comprehensive pediatrics training first. Say something like: 'I'm really interested in exploring pediatric cardiology, but I'm excited to get broad training first and see what resonates most during residency.' Never say you're ONLY interested in one subspecialty."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I handle vaccine refusal questions?",
      answer: "This is a common ethics question in peds interviews. The best approach: (1) Acknowledge parents' concerns empathetically, (2) Provide evidence-based information without being condescending, (3) Build trust over time, (4) Know when to involve the attending. Don't say you'd refuse to care for unvaccinated children (wrong answer). We practice this scenario extensively in mock interviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have limited pediatric experience beyond my core rotation?",
      answer: "Highlight what you DO have: your core pediatrics rotation, any pediatric research or volunteer work, experiences tutoring or working with children, even relevant personal experiences. Be honest about limited exposure but emphasize how every pediatric interaction confirmed your desire to pursue peds. We help you maximize whatever experiences you have."
